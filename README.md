# Telebyte

Telebyte is a simple robot with a phone mount, which can be controlled via Web APIs (REST/WebSockets).
It also has it's own behavior/event handling system, implemented using a behavior tree.

Telebyte is a work in progress. I'm a beginner in anything of this sort so I'm expecting it will take some time until completion.

The robot is designed to be controlled through WebRTC (p2p, 1 to 1), forwarding commands from the opposite peer to Telebyte remotely.
